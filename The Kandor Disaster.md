# The Altan Pursuit of Trilium: The Kandor Disaster

## Section 1: The Pursuit of Trilium
The Altans, a species of boundless intellect and ambition, had always regarded Trilium as the keystone of their civilization’s advancements. This strange crystalline material, humming with untamed energy, fueled their greatest inventions and inspired their most daring aspirations. Yet, the enigmatic nature of Trilium left many questions unanswered. What lay beneath its chaotic resonance? Could it be fully controlled, or was its power part of something much larger, something unknown?
Driven by curiosity and the desire to secure more of this transformative resource, the Altans set their sights on Asteroid Kandor — a massive rock in the outer belt known for its rich trilium deposits. Scans suggested Kandor might hold deposits far greater than any discovered on their homeworld, and the lure of unlocking the asteroid’s secrets was impossible to resist.
The research center atop Alta’s northern peaks was abuzz with activity. Holoscreens flickered with images of Kandor’s jagged surface, and projections detailed the asteroid’s volatile orbit. Eridani, an elder scientist with a reputation for calculated risk-taking, addressed the gathered team.
"Fellow Altans," he began, his voice calm but brimming with conviction, "we stand at the threshold of discovery. Kandor offers us an unprecedented opportunity to deepen our understanding of Trilium and its origins."
Donni, a younger scientist renowned for her unrelenting drive, stepped forward. "And it’s a challenge worthy of us. No other species could dream of undertaking such a mission. If Trilium has more secrets to reveal, Kandor is where we’ll find them."
Not everyone shared their enthusiasm. Faelix, a logistics expert, raised a hand. "I’ll remind you both that Kandor’s environment is entirely uncharted. Its surface is unstable, its energy readings erratic. We’ll need every precaution to ensure this mission isn’t our last."
"Precautions will be taken," Eridani assured him. "But hesitation will only rob us of progress. We leave within the week."
The expedition’s vessel, crafted with the precision and elegance characteristic of Altan engineering, departed under the light of Alta’s twin moons. Donni gazed out at the stars, her thoughts racing. "Imagine what we might uncover. If the Trilium here is different—purer—it could redefine everything."
"Or it could destroy everything," Faelix muttered, checking his equipment.
The journey to Kandor was uneventful, but as the asteroid came into view, the crew was struck by its foreboding presence. Kandor was vast, its surface a chaotic labyrinth of crystalline spires and shadowed crevices.
"This place looks alive," Donni remarked as they prepared to land.
Eridani nodded. "Alive or not, it holds the answers we seek."

## Section 2: Exploring the Unknown
The team’s initial explorations confirmed the presence of Trilium deposits, but something about the asteroid unsettled them. The crystalline formations emitted faint, haunting hums that resonated in the air.
"This doesn’t match anything we’ve seen before," Donni said, kneeling by a cluster of crystals. "These veins aren’t just Trilium—they’re... layered, as if they’ve grown consciously."
Faelix frowned, his unease growing. "Let’s not romanticize it. It’s still just a mineral, even if it’s behaving oddly."
But as they ventured deeper, the oddities multiplied. The crystalline structures seemed to shift subtly when observed from different angles, and instruments malfunctioned near larger deposits. Eridani took note of the anomalies, his scientific curiosity outweighing his caution.
"We’re witnessing something extraordinary," he said. "This Trilium might have properties we’ve never imagined."
Months after their initial expedition to Kandor, the Altans returned to the asteroid, their curiosity now paired with determination. The samples they had collected from the previous mission revealed untapped potential. This Trilium wasn’t just a resource—it was an enigma that could redefine their understanding of energy and matter. Mining operations were not only a necessity but a gateway to new discoveries.
Eridani, the elder scientist who had led the first expedition, now headed the larger operation. Beside him was Donni, whose sharp insights into Trilium's unique properties had driven much of their research. Faelix, though still cautious after his injury, returned to oversee logistics and safety.
To bolster the team, the Altans enlisted Jovar, an engineer specializing in excavation technologies, and Janina, a geologist renowned for her ability to read the secrets hidden in stone.
"Every effort here must be precise," Eridani addressed the team as they prepared to land on Kandor. "This is not just about extraction. We are dealing with something we do not yet fully understand."
 
Their vessel, equipped with reinforced landing struts and vibration dampeners, touched down gently on Kandor’s rugged surface. As the bay doors opened, the team gazed at the alien landscape—a chaotic expanse of jagged crystalline spires and shimmering veins embedded in the asteroid’s rocky crust.
"Still eerie," Faelix muttered, activating his suit’s environment monitoring systems.
"Beautiful, though," Donni countered, stepping forward to inspect the terrain. "Let’s hope we can keep it intact while we work."
The first task was establishing a secure base. The team erected a modular mining station at the edge of a large crystalline valley. Built from lightweight alloys, the station was equipped with Seismic Stabilizers: To mitigate vibrations from mining that could destabilize Kandor’s fragile crust; Energy Barriers: To shield the station from potential Trilium energy surges; Atmospheric Tents: To create a stable work environment despite the asteroid’s thin, erratic atmosphere.
"Stabilizers are online," Jovar reported after securing the last unit. "We shouldn’t trigger a collapse if we follow the prescribed drill depths."
Janina nodded, analyzing the crystalline formations around them. "The deposits here are unlike any I’ve seen. They’re layered in a way that suggests slow, deliberate growth, but what’s feeding them? There’s no geothermal activity here."
"We’ll add that to the list of questions to answer," Eridani said. "For now, let’s focus on extraction."

## Section 3: The Mining Mission
The team deployed plasma cutters for precision removal of the crystalline Trilium veins. Unlike traditional drills, plasma cutters emitted focused energy beams capable of slicing through the hardest materials without causing unnecessary vibrations.
"Cutters calibrated," Jovar confirmed, his hands gliding over the control panel. "We’ll begin with a shallow trench along this vein."
Faelix supervised from a nearby ridge, monitoring the operation via drones. "Keep the energy output steady," he cautioned. "We don’t know how these veins will react under stress."
As the plasma cutters engaged, a faint hum filled the air—a resonance that seemed to ripple through the surrounding crystals.
"Is that normal?" Donni asked, her voice tense.
Janina studied the formations with a scanner. "It’s... localized. The Trilium seems to respond to the energy input, but it’s not destabilizing. Fascinating."
As they removed the first section of Trilium, the team encountered their first major hurdle: thermal dissipation. The crystalline structure absorbed heat from the plasma cutters, releasing it unpredictably into the environment.
"Temperatures in the trench are spiking," Faelix warned. "We need to cool it before we can continue."
Jovar adjusted the system to deploy cryogenic injectors, which released bursts of super-cooled gas to stabilize the area. "That should hold," he said, though his tone betrayed uncertainty.
"Every step reveals something new," Eridani observed. "Let’s document everything. These behaviors could teach us more about Trilium’s properties."
After days of careful work, the team unearthed a massive deposit—a cluster of Trilium crystals embedded in the asteroid’s rocky core. The veins pulsed faintly, their rhythmic glow casting eerie patterns on the cavern walls.
"This is it," Donni whispered, captivated by the sight. "The heart of Kandor’s mystery."
Jovar set up the hydraulic extractors, devices designed to gently pull the crystals free without fracturing them. Each extractor was equipped with a sensor array to monitor stress levels in real time.
As the first crystal was removed, the asteroid seemed to shudder slightly.
"Seismic readings are within limits," Faelix reported, though his hands hovered over the emergency controls.
Eridani nodded. "Continue, but be ready to stop at the first sign of instability."
The deeper they mined, the more erratic the Trilium’s behavior became. At times, the crystals emitted bursts of energy that interfered with the team’s equipment.
"Radiation levels spiked again," Janina called out, shielding her scanner.
"Switch to manual overrides," Jovar instructed. "The automated systems can’t handle these fluctuations."

## Section 4: The Catastrophic Incident
The mining accident that caused the cavern collapse was only the beginning of the crew's troubles. In the chaos, a rupture in the crystalline veins of Trilium released a concentrated burst of trilium in the gaseous state that filled the chamber. Several members of the team, caught in the confusion and without proper isolation equipment, inhaled the toxic substance before escaping to safety.
What initially seemed like a near-miss turned into a nightmare as the long-term effects of the gas exposure became apparent.
For the first few days after the accident, the exposed miners appeared unscathed. Faelix, who had been closest to the rupture, dismissed the incident as nothing more than an unlucky encounter. "I feel fine," he insisted during their debrief. "We have more pressing concerns, like salvaging what’s left of the operation."
Donni, however, wasn’t convinced. "Trilium gas isn’t inert," she said, scanning the team for any subtle signs of physiological changes. "Its energy signature is volatile. We’ve seen what raw Trilium can do to organic matter."
The team’s lack of full protective gear during the accident nagged at her. Their suits were designed for environmental adaptation, but they hadn’t anticipated exposure to an airborne form of Trilium. The gas’s subatomic structure allowed it to penetrate the suit’s filters, reaching the body’s most sensitive systems.

## Section 5: Mysterious Mutations
It wasn’t long before the symptoms began. Faelix, the first to show signs, woke up sweating and disoriented. His skin, particularly near his hands and neck, appeared slightly darker and faintly iridescent under light.
"Probably just dehydration," Faelix muttered when Donni noticed.
But by the following day, the discoloration had spread, and Faelix complained of persistent fatigue and tingling sensations in his extremities. His heartbeat was irregular, and scans showed elevated cellular activity in his tissues.
"Something’s wrong," Donni said, her voice tight with worry as she reviewed Faelix’s vitals. "The Trilium gas must have triggered an internal reaction."
The team’s medics quickly analyzed Faelix’s condition. Their findings were startling, Subcellular interaction: Trilium gas molecules had bonded with Faelix’s cellular membranes, disrupting normal cell function. The gas’s unique resonance caused proteins within the cells to misfold, creating unstable structures; Genetic activation: The gas appeared to interact with DNA at a quantum level. Certain dormant genes—many of them related to rapid cell replication and growth—were inexplicably activated, leading to uncontrolled tissue development; Energetic imbalance: Trilium’s energy infused Faelix’s mitochondria, the powerhouses of his cells, causing them to overproduce ATP (the cell’s energy currency). This flood of energy led to erratic cellular behavior and inflammation in his organs.
"The mutations are accelerating," Donni observed grimly. "If we don’t find a way to stabilize his condition, his body could tear itself apart."
Faelix wasn’t the only one affected. Jovar, who had also been near the gas rupture, began experiencing similar symptoms. His initial signs were subtle—an increase in muscle mass and heightened sensory awareness—but these soon turned dangerous. His muscles began growing uncontrollably, leading to painful swelling and impaired mobility.
"This isn’t enhancement," Jovar said through gritted teeth. "It’s chaos."
Even Janina, who had inhaled a smaller amount of the gas, started showing cognitive disruptions. She reported vivid hallucinations and difficulty focusing, signs that the Trilium had reached her nervous system.
The mutations weren’t uniform. Each exposed miner showed a unique response, driven by their genetic makeup and the extent of their exposure. Faelix’s skin thickened into an iridescent, almost armor-like texture. While it offered some protection, it hindered his body’s ability to sweat and regulate temperature, leading to overheating. For Jovar, his muscle tissue overproduced growth factors, causing hypertrophy that compressed his internal organs. Breathing and circulation became increasingly difficult. For Janina, the Trilium’s effects on her nervous system caused hyperactive neural firing. While she could process information faster than before, it came at the cost of severe headaches and mental instability.
"These mutations aren’t enhancements—they’re a breakdown of the body’s balance," Eridani said during a meeting. "The Trilium is rewriting their physiology, and we don’t know how far it will go."
The mutations continued to escalate rapidly, overtaking the affected miners. Faelix was the first to succumb. His breathing slowed, his hardened skin reflecting an otherworldly sheen under the dim lighting of the mining base. He stumbled mid-step, eyes glazing over before he collapsed to the ground, unconscious.
"He's not breathing properly!" Donni shouted, kneeling beside him, her hands trembling as she checked his pulse. It was faint, irregular, as though his body struggled against itself.
Jovar was next. His overgrown muscles began to seize, his body convulsing violently before he, too, fell still. Janina, who had been pacing the room and muttering incoherently, suddenly froze. She let out a single, sharp gasp and collapsed.
"They’re... shutting down," Donni whispered, horror in her voice. "Their bodies can’t handle the strain of the mutations. It’s like they’re caught between living and something else."
Eridani took control of the situation, his usually calm demeanor now tinged with urgency. "We need to stabilize them and get them aboard the ship. If we leave them here, they won’t survive."
The remaining crew worked quickly, wrapping the unconscious miners in insulated survival blankets. Each movement felt labored, the weight of the situation pressing down on them like the asteroid’s cold, alien air.
"Careful," Eridani cautioned as they hoisted Faelix onto a stretcher. His body, now partially encased in hardened tissue, was heavier than expected. "We don’t know how fragile they’ve become."
The base, once a hub of hope and exploration, now felt suffocating. The faint hum of the Trilium deposits resonated in the walls, a haunting reminder of the substance’s dangerous power.
The walk back to the vessel was slow and deliberate. The crew navigated Kandor’s jagged terrain under a dim field of artificial lights, each step an effort to avoid triggering further instability. The unconscious miners lay motionless on stretchers, their mutated bodies eerily silent.
As the ship’s airlock hissed open, Eridani barked orders. "Medical bay. Now."
Donni and the others carried the victims inside, securing them in stasis pods designed for critical injuries. The pods monitored their vitals, which fluctuated erratically, as if their bodies fought an invisible battle.
"They’re alive," Donni said, her voice barely above a whisper. "But it’s like they’re... paused. Suspended between life and—" She stopped herself, unwilling to finish the thought.
The ship departed Kandor in silence, its engines a low hum against the void. The remaining crew gathered in the main cabin, their exhaustion evident in every gesture. Eridani stood at the helm, staring at the asteroid’s retreating form through the viewport.
"Kandor isn’t just a mining site," he said, breaking the silence. "It’s a warning. We’ve unleashed something we don’t understand, and now our people are paying the price."
Donni sat nearby, her eyes fixed on the medical bay’s monitors. The glowing lines tracking the miners’ vitals pulsed faintly, holding steady but not improving. "Do you think they’ll ever wake up?"
Eridani didn’t answer immediately. "I don’t know," he admitted. "But we’ll do everything in our power to find out."

## Section 6: Return to Alta
The ship’s descent toward Alta’s capital, Alta Prime, was marked by a gravity that extended beyond the physical pull of the planet. The crew, haggard and silent, prepared to deliver the news to the council of scientists and leaders awaiting their return. As the ship landed at the central port, medics and officials swarmed the vessel.
"Report," an official demanded, his voice sharp.
Donni stepped forward, her expression resolute despite the weight of her words. "We’ve encountered a critical incident. Several crew members were exposed to raw Trilium gas during a mining accident. Their bodies have undergone severe mutations, and they’re now in a state of suspended animation."
The official’s stern expression faltered for a moment. "Mutations? Suspended animation?"
"Yes," Eridani confirmed, stepping beside Donni. "Their systems are overwhelmed. Trilium has interacted with their biology in ways we’ve never seen. They need immediate care, and we need answers."
The unconscious miners were carefully transported to Alta Prime’s advanced medical facility, their stasis pods surrounded by a team of specialists. Donni followed closely, unwilling to let them out of her sight.

## Section 7:  Unraveling the Effects of Trilium Induced Mutation
In the sterile glow of the medical center, the Altan scientists began their assessments. Probes and scanners hovered over the miners, capturing detailed images of their altered physiology.
"Their cellular structures are... unrecognizable in places," one biologist muttered, studying Faelix’s scans. "It’s as if their DNA is being rewritten constantly, like a living algorithm running out of control."
Another scientist examined Janina’s neural scans. "Her brain activity is still high, but chaotic. It’s as if her mind is trapped in a waking dream."
The state-of-the-art medical facility in Alta Prime buzzed with subdued urgency. The unconscious miners were secured in bio-containment chambers, their stasis pods shielded by layers of energy barriers to prevent any further interactions with the residual Trilium energy lingering in their mutated bodies.
Among the specialists gathered to examine the miners were a team of molecular biologists led by Dr. Kaelen, a renowned expert in genomic instability and radiation-induced mutations. He was accompanied by two other researchers, Dr. Syra, a biochemist specializing in cellular metabolism, and Dr. Ryn, a pharmacologist with expertise in designing targeted molecular therapies.
"These mutations are unlike anything recorded," Dr. Yumay said as he reviewed the initial scans. "The Trilium hasn’t just disrupted their biology—it’s embedded itself into their molecular structures. We’ll need to map out exactly how much energy they’ve absorbed to design any form of treatment."
The first step was collecting biological samples. Clad in reinforced isolation suits, the team approached Faelix’s chamber, where his body lay still, his skin shimmering faintly under the room’s light. Using a sterile, insulated needle, Dr. Syra drew a sample of his blood, ensuring minimal exposure to herself and her equipment.
"His blood is... denser than usual," she remarked, holding the sample up to the light. "The Trilium might have altered its viscosity. Let’s get this to the sequencers."
Samples were also taken from Jovar and Janina, including blood, epithelial cells, and even small biopsies of muscle tissue. Each sample was immediately placed into containment units designed to prevent the spread of Trilium’s resonant energy.
In the laboratory, the samples were processed through quantum-field genetic sequencers, advanced machines capable of detecting alterations at both the genetic and subatomic levels. The team began by analyzing the miners’ DNA to assess the extent of the mutations.
Dr. Yumay examined Faelix’s genome first. "Look at this," he said, pointing to the holographic display. The DNA strands appeared fragmented and irregular, with unusual glowing markers indicating areas of high Trilium energy absorption.
"It’s as if parts of his DNA have been overwritten," Dr. Syra noted, her brow furrowing. "The Trilium energy seems to have acted as a mutagenic catalyst, disrupting the integrity of his genome."
For Jovar, the findings were even more striking. His DNA showed hyperactive gene expression in regions associated with cell growth and repair. "The Trilium didn’t just damage his DNA—it amplified certain pathways beyond control," Dr. Yumay said. "No wonder his muscle tissue overgrew."
Janina’s scans revealed a different pattern. The Trilium energy had primarily affected her neural pathways, disrupting the genes responsible for neurotransmitter production and regulation. "This explains the heightened brain activity and hallucinations," Dr. Kylis said. "Her neurons are firing in chaotic patterns, almost like they’re short-circuiting."
The next step was quantifying how much Trilium energy each victim had absorbed. Using spectral energy assays, the biologists measured the residual Trilium resonance within the cellular structures. The results were staggering.
"For Faelix," Dr. Syra explained, "the energy levels in his cells are 200% above his estimated Mutation Tolerance Threshold (MTT). That’s enough to disrupt his genome but not completely destabilize it—hence the hardened skin and slowed metabolism."
Jovar’s readings were even higher. "He absorbed Trilium energy at nearly 300% past his MTT," Dr. Yumay said. "His body tried to adapt by accelerating growth and repair mechanisms, but it couldn’t keep up with the energy’s chaotic influence. The result was uncontrolled hypertrophy."
Janina’s measurements were unusual. "Her Trilium absorption is lower than the others, only 150% above her MTT," Dr. Kylis said, "but it’s concentrated almost entirely in her brain and central nervous system. That localized exposure explains the extreme effects on her cognition."
The medical team worked tirelessly, cycling through one treatment protocol after another, desperate to halt the effects of Trilium-induced mutation. Faelix’s skin had hardened further, forming a nearly impenetrable carapace. Jovar’s muscles continued to swell beyond control, constricting his internal organs. Janina remained unconscious, her neural activity fluctuating wildly, sometimes spiking into patterns that suggested fragmented consciousness.
"The inhibitors aren’t working," Dr. Syra admitted, her voice heavy with exhaustion. "The Trilium energy has fused with their cells in ways we can’t fully understand. It’s like the energy has rewritten the rules of their biology."
Dr. Yumay leaned over a holographic display of Faelix’s genome, his brows furrowed in frustration. "The mutations are too deeply ingrained. Even with our best tools, we’re only treating symptoms. The root cause—this Trilium energy resonance—remains beyond our reach."
"Every protocol we’ve tried has failed," Dr. Kylis added grimly. "We don’t have the expertise or the technology to undo this. Not here."
The room fell silent as the weight of her words sank in. Donni, standing nearby, clenched her fists. She had been by Faelix’s side since the accident and had seen the toll the mutations had taken on all three victims. They were her colleagues, her friends, and she couldn’t accept that their fates were sealed.

## Section 8: A Desperate Search for Solutions
"There’s one place that might be able to help," Donni said, breaking the silence. "Altan Research Technologies."
Dr. Yumay hesitated. "ART has the resources, yes, but even they’ve only scratched the surface of understanding Trilium. This... mutation is something new."
"New or not," Donni countered, "they’re our best chance. If anyone can figure this out, it’s them."
The decision was unanimous. The medical team drafted a formal request to ART, detailing the miners’ conditions, the absorption levels of Trilium energy far beyond their MTT, and the facility’s failed attempts at reversing the effects.
"Be thorough," Dr. Yumay instructed as he reviewed the document. "They need to understand the gravity of this situation."
Dr. Syra added the data from the spectral energy assays, highlighting the alarming levels of cellular disruption. Dr. Kylis appended a summary of the unsuccessful treatments, emphasizing the unprecedented nature of the mutations.
Finally, Donni included a personal note: These are not just patients; they are Altans. They are explorers who risked everything in the pursuit of discovery. We owe it to them—and to ourselves—to find a way forward.
